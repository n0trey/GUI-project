# GUI Project using Python


Hey! This is my project in 1st year of college in Programming Algorithm Course
* I created a Graphic User Interface for thermal expansion calculation using Python
* It's able to calculate 3 types of thermal expansion: **linear, area, and volume**
* You need to input the Î±, to see the calculation result
* The calculation results are the **expansion in centimeter** and the **expansion graphic**
